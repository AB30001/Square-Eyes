# Square-Eyes
Project-Square-Eyes


It has been fun building this website. It's not perfect, but as my first website, I did everything I could in this amount of time. I really put good amount of hours in it and I was enjoying it.
My brain almost fried several times, but this is how you learn. :)

Everything is in HTML folder, in one folder, apologies for that, I am submiting last hour, no time for fixing :D
And it's quite messy in general, not the cleanest website for sure :D

Movie Sweetheart is with active button link for product page.
Active footer links: Contact Us, About Us.
Home Page active button: Get Started.


7/8 pages was error free before I made burger drop down menu for mobile, also it gives two extra errors, small errors, I'm not fixing them, because there is no time.

Product list page giving error about buttons, I'm not sure how to fix that, I tried.

Take care!

Have a good summer!
