It has been fun building this website. It's not perfect, but as my firs website, I did everything I could in this amount of time. I really put good amount of hours in it and I was enjoying it.
My brain almost fried several times, but this is how you learn. :)

Everything is in HTML folder, in one folder, apologies for that, I am submiting last hour, no time for fixing :D
And it's quite messy in general, not the cleanest website for sure :D

Take care!

Have a good summer!
